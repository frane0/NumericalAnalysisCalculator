# Numerical Analysis Calculator

This project has been developed by Ahmet Hakan Ergün for the semester project of Numerical Analysis course at YTU. 

This calculator is a tool for making complex numerical calculations. The calculator takes the input function or matrix as a string and makes the selected calculation method. Impelemted numerical methods are:
1. Bisection
2. Regula-Falsi
3. Newton-Rapshon
4. Inverse of an NxN Matrix
5. Gauss Elimination
6. Gauss-Seidel
7. Numerical Differentiation
8. Simpson’s Rule (1/3 and 3/8 Rules)
9. Trapezoidal Rule
10. Gregory-Newton Interpolation without Variable Transformation
